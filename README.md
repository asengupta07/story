## **2. Core Features**

### **2.1 Creator-Centric Story Development**
- **Two Creator Modes:**
  - **Self-Writers:** Manually write and publish chapters on a set schedule.
  - **AI-Agent Writers:** Provide story parameters (genre, premise, characters), and an AI generates draft chapters for review/editing (requires staking $STORY tokens for subscription).
- **Flexible Publishing:** Creators set chapter release intervals. AI users can override AI-generated drafts before publishing.
- **Story Direction Control:** Creators can adjust plot, characters, and AI outputs anytime.

### **2.2 Reader Engagement & Gamification**
- **Interactive Tools:**
  - **Mini-Quizzes/Polls:** Auto-generated from story content to test reader knowledge.
  - **Prediction Votes:** Readers predict plot twists and earn **Story Coins** for correct guesses.
  - **Streak System:** Rewards consistent reading (e.g., daily login bonuses).
- **Limited-Supply Perks (FCFS Model):**
  - **Rarity System:**
    - *Common Perks:* Small changes (e.g., naming a minor object/place).
    - *Rare Perks:* Mid-tier influence (e.g., changing a character’s decision).
    - *Legendary Perks:* Major changes (e.g., introducing a new character, limited to 1 per X chapters with a 5-chapter cooldown).
  - **Perk Valuation:** More readers increase perk cost; fewer readers reduce it.
  - **Perk Bidding:** Readers can bid $STORY tokens to claim high-value perks.

### **2.3 Monetization & Web3 Integration**
- **Native Token ($STORY):**
  - Readers buy $STORY to purchase perks (80% to creators, 20% platform fee).
  - **Staking for AI-Agent Writers:** To subscribe, users must stake $STORY, adding to the liquidity pool.
  - **Dynamic Token Pricing:** Perk value scales with story readership.
- **Brand Collaborations:**
  - Brands pay to feature products/names in stories (AI verifies brand mentions).
  - Creators can opt-out of brand deals.
- **Smart Contracts:** Handle all transactions for transparency.
